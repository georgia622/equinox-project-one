### Design Choices 
The overall website is designed to capture the ambience of the bar. A clean look with neutral and green colours to keep within the theme of the bar, nature and the seasons. All design choices have been made with this in mind. 

#### Fonts 
* The primary font is **Alice**, this has been chosen due to it's eclectic, quaint style and soft rounded features that will add visual interest to the page while remaining readable. This is also the font used in the brand logo, so this will keep the look of the wesbite consistent. 
* The secondary font will be **Lora**. This was chosen because Lora works well with Alice for font pairing because they have similar letterforms.

#### Colours 
* The primary colour choices are **#304326**, a dark green, and **#FBFDD4**, a light cream colour. These were chosen for the logo and buttons as they compliment eachother well and the contrast between the colours makes the content easy to read and visually interesting. 
* Other colours used throughout the website were chosen to compliment the primary colours and to match the images chosen. 

#### Background & Images
* The primary background colour for the homepage will be **#304326** (dark green). The colour **#FBFDD4** (light cream) will be used for the background against text to create contrast from the dark green, both colours compliment all of the images selected for this page. 
* The hero image on the home page has been chosen to create a positive emotion as soon as the user enters the website and to entice the user to explore the site further. It shows a preview of what the drinks look like. The image contains greenery in the background of the drinks which match the background colours and the theme of the bar. 
* All images were chosen as they are high quality and consistent in style. They clearly show the variety of drinks on offer. Images were sourced from Unsplash, a website providing free to use images. 

#### Styling

* The corners of the boxes containing text content have been kept sharp and not rounded to give those sections a professional look, this creates a visual contrast between the font (which has soft rounded edges) and it's container.  This is repeated throughout the website on all pages so that the website feels and looks cohesive.

* The images on the drinks menu will be circular, this is to create a slight difference between the menu images and the images on the other pages. The styling of the images will be more visually appealing while also saving space on the page as the menu will have more text. 

* All buttons will have sharp corners to once again give a professional look and to highlight the importance of the button.
